Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. 
How does it work?

Imagine you're throwing a party at your house. You want to control who comes in, where they can go, and what they can do. That's kind of like what Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) does for your cloud resources.

Here's the breakdown:

Your House (VPC): Just like your house, a VPC is your private space in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It's where you keep all your resources like servers, databases, and applications.

Rooms (Subnets): Inside your house, you have different rooms for different purposes - living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. Similarly, in a VPC, you create subnets, which are like different sections for different types of resources. For example, you might have a subnet for your web servers and another for your database servers.

Doors and Windows (Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists): To control who gets into your house and which rooms they can access, you have doors and windows with locks. In a VPC, you use security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to control the traffic in and out of your subnets.

Neighbors (Other VPCs and the Internet): Sometimes, you might want to invite people from other houses to your party, or maybe you want to go visit them. Similarly, in a VPC, you can connect to other VPCs or the internet to access resources or allow others to access yours.

Security Guards (Network Firewall and VPN): To make sure everything stays safe and secure, you might hire security guards. In a VPC, you can set up network firewalls and VPN (Virtual Private Network) connections to protect your resources from unauthorized access.

So, AWS VPC is like your own private space in the cloud where you can control everything from who gets in to how they move around, keeping your resources safe and organized.


What is an Internet gateway
Normally when you create a VPC, it does not have internet connection to outer world. But if you want some of the resources within the VPC to iteract with public through internet,
you can do so by enabling an internet gateway. For example, if you have a website, then you want people to access it. So you enable an internet gateway for the VPC and put the website on a public 
subnet. You can place the data in a private subnet and deny public access to the data.

What is a virtual private gateway?
a private gateway that only allows people in if they are coming from an approved network, not the public internet. This private doorway is called a virtual private gateway, and it allows you to create a VPN connection between a private network, like your on-premises data center or
internal corporate network to your VPC

What is AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a completely private, dedicated fiber connection from your data center to AWS. You work with a Direct Connect partner in your
area to establish this connection, because  AWS Direct Connect provides a physical line that connects your network to your AWS VPC. This can help you meet high
regulatory and compliance needs, as well as sidestep any potential bandwidth issues.
