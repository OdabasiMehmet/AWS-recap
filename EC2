## **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**
Amazon EC2  is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, called instances, in the cloud. 
With EC2, users can quickly scale compute capacity up or down based on their requirements, paying only for the resources they use.

### **EC2 Types**
1. General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.
2. Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. 
3. Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. 
4. Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
5. Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.
