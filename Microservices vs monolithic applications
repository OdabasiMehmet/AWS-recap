Applications are generally made up off various components, such as the application and database. In creating our applications, we can either tightly 
couple the components or loosely couple the components. It is up to us to choose the method. However, in tightly coupled models, if one of the components
fail then the entire system fails. On the other hand, in loosely coupled systems, a failed component does not stop the whole application but only the failed component itself.

Below are the differences between monolithic design (tightly coupled) and microservices approach (loosely coupled)

Monolithic Applications:
Architecture: Monolithic applications are built as a single, indivisible unit. All components, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are tightly coupled and packaged together.

Deployment: In monolithic architectures, the entire application is deployed as a single unit. Updates or changes to any part of the application require redeploying the entire monolith.

Scalability: Scaling a monolithic application involves replicating the entire application stack, including components that might not require additional resources. This can lead to inefficient resource utilization.

Development: In monolithic architectures, multiple development teams often work on different modules within the same codebase. This can lead to coordination challenges, especially as the codebase grows larger.

Testing: Testing a monolithic application involves testing the entire system together. As the application grows, testing becomes more complex and time-consuming.

Technology Stack: Monolithic applications typically use a single technology stack, chosen at the beginning of the project. This can limit flexibility and innovation, especially as new technologies emerge.

Microservices:
Architecture: Microservices architectures decompose applications into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific business function. These services communicate with each other via APIs or messaging protocols.

Deployment: Each microservice can be deployed independently, allowing for continuous delivery and deployment. Updates or changes to a single service do not require redeploying the entire application.

Scalability: Microservices architectures allow for granular scalability. Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand, leading to more efficient resource utilization.

Development: Microservices architectures promote smaller, more focused development teams, each responsible for a specific service. This can improve agility and reduce coordination overhead.

Testing: Testing in a microservices architecture focuses on individual services, making it easier to isolate and test specific functionality. This can improve test coverage and reduce the risk of regressions.

Technology Stack: Microservices architectures allow for polyglot development, where each service can use a different technology stack best suited for its requirements. This enables teams to leverage the right tools and technologies for each service.
